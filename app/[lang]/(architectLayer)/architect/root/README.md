# `/architect/root` — the section of the node's root element

The root of the domain belongs to the `root` element (repository `fractera-root-starter` by
default), installed in `AGI-ITEMS/core/root`. This section is where the architect works with it.

| Page | Order | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `preview` | 10 | the first page of the section; its content is still to be agreed with the owner |
| `claude-code` | 30 | Claude Code subscription (agent kit) |
| `terminal` | 40 | the element's own agent, started in `AGI-ITEMS/core/root` (agent kit) |
| `telegram` | 50 | the element's Telegram bot (agent kit) |
| `external-github` | 60 | how a foreign repository becomes the root of the node (step 280-8) |

The three agent-kit pages are installed by `npm run agent-kit:add -- root`; their parameters live
in `agent-kit.json` next to this file. Named «Root», not «Site»: some builders make sites here,
others make automations (the owner's word of 2026-09-23).
